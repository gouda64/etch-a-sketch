# Etch-a-Sketch

This may be the most unorganized project yet. The Javascript is absolutely horrendous, bad coding practices abound, and there are barely any comments to clarify. I salute anyone brave enough to look at it.

All that aside, although it's not much, I actually feel quite proud of creating this fun little site from scratch.

Possible future features:
  - Transparency
  - Clear (if you change the grid size it automatically clears anyways)
  - Export drawing
  - Color picker
  - Different brushes
